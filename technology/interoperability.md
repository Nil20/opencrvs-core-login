# Interoperability

### OpenCRVS provides flexible interoperability options via OpenHIM, FHIR and a Webhooks microservice

It is really up to you how you would like to interoperate with OpenCRVS.  You have 2 main options:

1. OpenHIM tracks and exposes events and documents as [FHIR](https://hl7.org/FHIR/).  You can accces these events directly via authenticated API integrations to OpenHIM or ...
2. &#x20;Subscribe to the OpenCRVS **Webhooks** microservice. &#x20;

You perform any data manipulation or conversion that you may need using small custom microservices called: Mediators.





To integrate with OpenCRVS, the recommended approach is to host a microservice on your platform that can interact with OpenHIM. This microservice is referred to as a mediator.



**MOSIP Example**

A technical proof of concept mediator that exposes civil registration events via a Webhook to the [MOSIP - the Modular Open Source Identity Platform](https://www.mosip.io/) is documented [here](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/integrations/mosip-opencrvs-integration).

This integration represents A FHIR standardised approach to ensuring that a birth registration directly creates a National ID number with optional biometrics. This interoperability ensures that the legal identity established at birth is then utilised as a foundational identity to access other services (e.g. health, education, financial inclusion, passport, mobile phone etc.) and to ensure that we leave no one behind.



A mediator, with the right scope and permissions can interact with existing endpoints in the OpenCRVS stack. But the most logical integration point is to subscribe to OpenCRVS Webhooks.

To set up a mediator with the right permissions there is no GUI, your system administrator is required to:

1. SSH into the OpenCRVS manager node and register a new system client. Described below.
2. Securely host the system `client_id`, `client_secret` and `sha_secret`, returned in the registration process, as environment variables or secrets that your mediator or webhook subscriber service has secure access to.

Your mediator microservice is then required to:

1. Authenticate and request an access token. Described below.
2. Develop a mediator or webhook subscriber to perform your required business functions. We expose some OpenCRVS events as Webhooks which can be a good way to interact immediately if the supported events are of interest to you.

#### Register a system client

**In the upcoming OpenCRVS Beta release the following process will be deprecated and replaced by a GUI in the System Administrator User Team Management functionality.**

Using a valid system administrator JWT token returned during OpenCRVS client authentication, SSH into your manager instance and run the following commands to register a new client.

Find a running auth service Docker container ID. NOTE: You may need to connect to a worker node if auth is not running on the manager.

```
docker ps -a
```

```
docker exec <Insert auth service container id on node> \
wget -S --header="Authorization: Bearer <Insert your valid system administrator JWT here>" \
--header='Accept-Charset: UTF-8' --header='Content-Type: application/json' \
--post-data â€˜{"scope":"NATIONAL_ID"}' \
-O - http://user-mgnt:3030/registerSystemClient
```

**Request payload**

Example json

```
{
    "scope": "NATIONAL_ID",
}
```

| Parameter | Sample value  | Description                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scope`   | `NATIONAL_ID` | Available integration scopes currently include: **NATIONAL\_ID** **HEALTH** **AGE\_CHECK** **EXTERNAL\_VALIDATION**. |

**Request Response**

The command will return the following details:

```
{
    "client_id": "2fd153ab-86c8-45fb-990d-721140e46061",
    "client_secret": "8636abe2-affb-4238-8bff-200ed3652d1e",
    "sha_secret": "d04aec67-1ef4-467a-a5a8-fa5c89ad71ce"
}
```

These are your authentication, and webhook payload verification details for your API and should be stored securely in line with your organisation's security policies and never exposed in code repositories.

| Parameter       | Sample value                           | Description                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `client_id`     | `2fd153ab-86c8-45fb-990d-721140e46061` | The client id used in the authentication process for system clients.         |
| `client_secret` | `8636abe2-affb-4238-8bff-200ed3652d1e` | The client secret used in the authentication process for system clients.     |
| `sha_secret`    | `d04aec67-1ef4-467a-a5a8-fa5c89ad71ce` | The **SHA1** signature used when verifying that a webhook payload is genuine |

#### Deactivate a system client

Using a valid system administrator JWT token returned during OpenCRVS client authentication, SSH into your manager instance and run the following commands to deactivate an existing client:

Find a running auth service Docker container ID. NOTE: You may need to connect to a worker node if auth is not running on the manager.

```
docker ps -a
```

Run the following command replacing the client\_id with the client\_id you wish to deactivate. You can browse the **user-mgnt > systems** collection in Mongo to find the client details.

```
docker exec <Insert auth service container id on node> \
wget -S --header="Authorization: Bearer <Insert your valid JWT here>" \
--header='Accept-Charset: UTF-8' --header='Content-Type: application/json' \
--post-data '{"client_id":"2fd153ab-86c8-45fb-990d-721140e46061"}' \
-O - http://user-mgnt:3030/deactivateSystemClient
```

#### Reactivate a deactivated system client

Using a valid system administrator JWT token returned during OpenCRVS client authentication, SSH into your manager instance and run the following commands to reactivate a previously deactivated client:

Find a running auth service Docker container ID. NOTE: You may need to connect to a worker node if auth is not running on the manager.

```
docker ps -a
```

Run the following command replacing the client\_id with the client\_id you wish to reactivate. You can browse the **user-mgnt > systems** collection in Mongo to find the client details.

```
docker exec <Insert auth service container id on node> \
wget -S --header="Authorization: Bearer <Insert your valid JWT here>" \
--header='Accept-Charset: UTF-8' --header='Content-Type: application/json' \
--post-data '{"client_id":"2fd153ab-86c8-45fb-990d-721140e46061"}' \
-O - http://user-mgnt:3030/reactivateSystemClient
```
