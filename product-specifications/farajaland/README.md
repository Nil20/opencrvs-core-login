# Farajaland

Farajaland is a fictitious country used to illustrate how OpenCRVS is specifically designed to meet the needs of typical low-resource settings. Here is some background on Farajaland:

* A small country in sub-Saharan African with a population of approx. 2m people
* Farajaland is organised into Provinces and Districts as shown on the Farajaland map
* Rural and low population density
* Poor mobile phone reception in the remote areas
* North is French speaking / South is predominantly English speaking

**Civil registration in Farajaland**

* The Civil Registration Authority (CRA) has the mandate to register all births and deaths in Farajaland, as per the Births and Deaths Registration Act, last amended in 2021.
* The Births and Deaths Registration Act of 2021 includes a number of provisions for electronic registration processes, including the use of electronic signatures and the storage of historical vital event records in electronic format.
* The CRA has its HQ Office in XXX, which is led by the Registrar General. In this office there are a number of management positions, including a National Operations Manager and a National System Administrator.&#x20;
* an office in each of the 16 districts. In each office there is a Registrar with Registration Agents (RA) and Field Agents (FA), who are health staff with a role to notify births and deaths in the community (there is an MoU between CRA and MoH)
* In addition to the District offices, there is a National Registration Office, which is run by the Registrar General
