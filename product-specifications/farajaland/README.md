# Farajaland

Farajaland is a fictitious country used to illustrate how OpenCRVS is specifically designed to meet the needs of typical low-resource settings. The OpenCRVS demos are built around the needs of this country, which reflect a variety of real-life contexts from around the world.&#x20;

* Farajaland acts as the **default configuration**. The OpenCRVS product works "out of the box" so that functionality can be quickly demonstrated and explored, based on the needs of the Farajaland context.&#x20;
* The Farajaland configuration illustrates a number of **new service delivery models**, which have the potential to strengthen CRVS systems and improve key performance indicators, such as completeness rates, quality of vital events data etc. &#x20;

Take time to become familiar with Farajaland and its requirements for a digital CRVS system. This will help you to understand how to configure OpenCRVS based on your own needs. &#x20;
