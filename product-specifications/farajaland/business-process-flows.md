# Farajaland business process flows

There are 3 main service delivery models employed in Farajaland to provide effective civil registration services to the public. These service delivery models are as follows:

1. Notification from the community via a community leader
2. Notification from the health facility or hospital through an automated feed from the health system
3. Direct registration at the District Registration Office

For each of the service delivery models a digitally enabled business process has been defined that supports the model.
