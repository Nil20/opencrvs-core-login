# Business process flows

There are 3 main service delivery models employed in Farajaland to provide effective civil registration services to the public. These service delivery models are as follows:

1. Notification from the health facility (manual)
2. Notification from the health facility (automated)
3. Registration at the District Registration Office

For each of the service delivery models a digitally enabled business process has been defined that supports the model.
