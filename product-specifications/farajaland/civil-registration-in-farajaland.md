# Civil registration in Farajaland



**Civil registration in Farajaland**

* The Civil Registration Authority (CRA) has the mandate to register all births and deaths in Farajaland, as per the Births and Deaths Registration Act, last amended in 2021.
* The Births and Deaths Registration Act of 2021 includes a number of provisions for electronic civil registration processes, including the use of electronic signatures and the storage of vital event records in electronic format.
* The Executive Chairman of the CRA and person overall accountable for civil registration in Farajaland is the Registrar General. At the National level the CRA has its HQ Office in Isamba District. In this office there are a number of management positions, including a National Operations Manager and a National System Administrator.
* Civil registration in Farajaland is administered at the District level and there is a Civil Registration Office in each of the 16 districts. In each office there is a Registrar, who is the person that formally registers vital events and issues certificates. Supporting the Registrar are 2-3 Registration Officers and a number of field-based staff, such as health workers and community leaders that have a formal role to notify births and deaths in the community.
* There is an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the CRA and the Ministry of Health that assures that health staff are able to spend their time capturing details of vital events and formally notifying the Civil Registration Office.&#x20;
* Until recently Farajaland has been using manual, paper-based processes and the performance of the CRVS system has been poor. Completeness rates (within 1 year of event) have been at 40% (birth) and 15% (death). There are suspected low levels of data quality and large numbers of duplicate entries in the civil registry. Customer service has also been poor, with many families complaining that they have had to visit the Civil Registration Office a number of time to get vital events registered, which has proven time consuming and expensive.&#x20;
