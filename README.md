# Editing

1. When writing new content, always edit the latest documentation for the latest release.
2. When creating a new release, create a new collection and drag into OpenCRVS
3. To publish new release content, first unpublish all collections.  Then publish the collection you would like to be the MAIN content (latest release) first.  Then publish the previous version collection.  Keep any older release documentation unpublished and label the collection "DEPRECATED"
