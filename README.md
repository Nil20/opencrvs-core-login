# üëã Introduction

OpenCRVS is an open-source digital solution for civil registration designed specifically for low-resource settings and available as a Digital Public Good.

In this documentation you will find all you need to design, configure, operate and maintain an OpenCRVS application that meets your country's needs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend that you use this documentation in combination with the [CRVS Digitisation Guidebook](http://www.crvs-dgb.org/en/), an online resource that provides step-by-step guidance for countries to implement digitized systems and automated processes for CRVS.

### Why is OpenCRVS needed?

Civil registration is the foundation of legal identity and rights-based service delivery. A Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) system records the details of all major life events, such as births, deaths, marriage and divorce. It is an essential component of the "leave no one behind" agenda and without it working effectively, it is virtually impossible to ensure inclusive growth.&#x20;

Unfortunately in many countries CRVS systems are broken. 1 in 4 children under the age of 5 have not had their birth registered and hence do not officially exist. As a result, they struggle to access basic rights like education, healthcare and social protection.

Through our extensive research of CRVS systems around the world (including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malawi, Uganda and Ghana) we understand many of the specific challenges that are often experienced by civil registration staff and the families trying to register vital events:

* The civil registration processes are bureaucratic and time-consuming, with requests for supporting documents that family members do not possess and unofficial payments.&#x20;
* Family members need to travel long distances to register vital events with several trips often required before the registration process is complete and a certificate is obtained.
* Systems are not integrated so birth registration does not lead to automatic access to other rights e.g. vaccination programmes, enrolment in social protection schemes etc.

### Product Commitments

We still stand by our original product commitments for OpenCRVS and these help steer the strategic direction of the product:

* Fully open-source, with no license fees or ties to specific vendors
* Configurable for all country contexts&#x20;
* Interoperable with other government systems&#x20;
* Highly accessible to ensure inclusion, even in remote areas
* Safe and secure to keep personal data protected&#x20;
* Easy to deploy and use in low resource settings&#x20;
* Enabling new models of civil registration that can help achieve universal registration

### Design Principles

OpenCRVS solves the question of "Why?‚Äù with these principles:

#### **Start with users' needs**

Listen too, engage with and observe users. Spend time to understand their needs, assume nothing, and work with your users to create designs.

#### **Prioritise offline**

Every product feature must work offline and in areas of low connectivity. Where connectivity is required to complete an action, tell the user what's happening and always consider the loading state.

#### **Give guidance throughout**

The user shouldn't have any questions about what to do - it should be intuitive. Make the product simple and offer clear guidance every step of the way.

#### **Test, learn and iterate**

The best way to develop new features is to start small and release early. Get it into the hands of your users, listen - learn, and iterate.

#### **Enable rights**

We want to empower and protect those who use and are served by OpenCRVS. Is what you are designing likely to exclude or discriminate anyone? How can this be avoided?

#### **Be consistent**

Every part of the product should look and feel part of the whole - make use of the component library.

#### **Be hyper accessible**

Our users are from across the world with varying levels of digital literacy. Whatever we design must be as inclusive, legible and accessible as possible.

#### **Words matter**

Every word should be understood by users, with no room for interpretation. When drafting text, avoid use of administrative language and test it with local users.

#### **Design with data**

Use data generated from the system to inform design improvements.

#### **Consider other contexts**

OpenCRVS is a global product. Consider the variability of what you are designing - will it work in other countries and contexts, and how will it be easily configured?
