## OpenCRVS

[OpenCRVS](https://www.opencrvs.org/) (Civil registration & Vital Statistics) is a digital public good to help achieve universal civil registration and evidence-based decision making in all country contexts.

> **We are on a mission to ensure that every individual on the planet is recognised, protected and provided for from birth.**

## Important! Please read

Read our [installation instructions](https://documentation.opencrvs.org/setup/3.-installation) to understand:

1. How to set up a **local, demo development environment of OpenCRVS** using our fictional country configuration: "Farajaland".
2. How to set up your own country configuration
3. How to set up a server hosted environment

In order to run OpenCRVS, we expect that you have a working knowledge of Linux / Unix operating systems and can run terminal commands.

OpenCRVS consists of multiple servers which run in Docker containers and requires Node JS. You should be familiar with the concepts of Docker and Node JS web application software development.

Install the dependencies and follow the first time setup instructions. This will checkout, download, install, configure and start all the servers for you in order to get up and running quickly with OpenCRVS.

Read review our [documentation](http://documentation.opencrvs.org) for all the information you need.

## Configuring OpenCRVS

A companion example country configuration for Farajaland is checked out for you automatically using our setup script above. This country configuration server runs alongside opencrvs-core and serves languages, form configuration, logo files, adminisrative structure (jurisdictions and offices) etc. To see the code, learn more and fork for your requirements, visit our [documentation](http://documentation.opencrvs.org). The example country configuration repo. [opencrvs-farajaland](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland).
