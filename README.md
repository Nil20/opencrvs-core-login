# Editing

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTENT CREATORS:

1. When writing new content, always select the latest documentation for the latest release. E.G. the collection on the left navigation with the highest release number.
2. Select the page you wish to edit and click "Edit"
3. When you have finished making changes, click "Merge" to save and publish.



INSTRUCTIONS FOR TECH ARCH ONLY:

1. When creating a new release, create a new collection, or space, and drag into OpenCRVS
2. To publish a new release, first unpublish all collections.  Then publish the collection you would like to be the MAIN content (latest release) first.  IMPORTANT: You must choose "In Collection" after clicking "Publish".  Do not click "Public".  Then perform the same task for the previous release collection.  Keep any older release documentation unpublished and label the collection "DEPRECATED"
