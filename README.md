# Introduction

OpenCRVS is an open-source digital solution for civil registration designed for low resource settings and available as a Digital Public Good.

### Why?

* Civil registration is the foundation of legal identity and rights-based service delivery. A Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) system records the details of all major life events, such as births and deaths.&#x20;
* It is an essential component of the "leave no one behind" agenda and without it working effectively, it is virtually impossible to ensure inclusive growth.&#x20;
* Unfortunately in many countries CRVS systems are broken. 1 in 4 children under the age of 5 are not registered at birth and hence do not officially exist (UNICEF). As a result, they struggle to access basic rights like education, healthcare and social protection.
* We have conducted technical analysis of CRVS systems in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malawi, Uganda and understand the challenges experienced by parents when trying to register their children
* They need to travel long distances to register and often need to make several trips before receiving the birth certificate
* They are faced with bureaucratic civil registration process with long delays, requests for unofficial payments and are not kept informed about the status of their application
* Systems are not integrated so birth registration does not lead to automatic access to other rights e.g. vaccination programmes, enrolment in social protection schemes etc.



### Design Principles

OpenCRVS solves the question of "Why?” with these principles:

#### **Start with users' needs**

Listen too, engage with and observe users. Spend time to understand their needs, assume nothing, and work with your users to create designs.

#### **Prioritise offline**

Every product feature must work offline and in areas of low connectivity. Where connectivity is required to complete an action, tell the user what's happening and always consider the loading state.

#### **Give guidance throughout**

The user shouldn't have any questions about what to do - it should be intuitive. Make the product simple and offer clear guidance every step of the way.

#### **Test, learn and iterate**

The best way to develop new features is to start small and release early. Get it into the hands of your users, listen - learn, and iterate.

#### **Enable rights**

We want to empower and protect those who use and are served by OpenCRVS. Is what you are designing likely to exclude or discriminate anyone? How can this be avoided?

#### **Be consistent**

Every part of the product should look and feel part of the whole - make use of the component library.

#### **Be hyper accessible**

Our users are from across the world with varying levels of digital literacy. Whatever we design must be as inclusive, legible and accessible as possible.

#### **Words matter**

Every word should be understood by users, with no room for interpretation. When drafting text, avoid use of administrative language and test it with local users.

#### **Design with data**

Use data generated from the system to inform design improvements.

#### **Consider other contexts**

OpenCRVS is a global product. Consider the variability of what you are designing - will it work in other countries and contexts, and how will it be easily configured?
