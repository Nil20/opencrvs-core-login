3. When you have finished making changes, click "Merge" to save and publish.



INSTRUCTIONS FOR TECH ARCH ONLY:

1. When creating a new release, create a new collection and drag into OpenCRVS
2. To publish a new release, first unpublish all collections.  Then publish the collection you would like to be the MAIN content (latest release) first.  Then publish the previous version collection.  Keep any older release documentation unpublished and label the collection "DEPRECATED"
