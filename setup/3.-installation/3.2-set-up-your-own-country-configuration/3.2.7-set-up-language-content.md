# 3.2.7 Set-up language content

It is possible to amend all text copy in OpenCRVS and as as many translations as you like.



**Technical background**

Content management approach is developed in OpenCRVS using [FormatJS](https://formatjs.io/) .  It is worthwhile reading their documentation to understand how this technically works, particularly this [page](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/basic-internationalization-principles).

FormatJS uses industry-wide i18n standards that allow the JSON created to imported into enterprise level content management systems such as [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) or [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/).  As an example we automatically export files ready for Contentful import if you wish to use it, although it is not necessary and you can customise any content integration you like using code in the Farajaland country configuration repository.



**Configuring content**

Client Application: Internationalisation and languages can be configured in [client.json](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-blob/master/src/features/languages/generated/client/client.json).  The client JSON looks like this:

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "lang": "en",
      "displayName": "English",
      "messages": {
        "buttons.add": "Add",
        "buttons.apply": "Apply",
        ...
```

You edit copy directly in JSON so you will need a code editor like VSCode

SMS Notifications: Internationalisation and languages can be configured in [notification.json](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-blob/master/src/features/languages/generated/notification/notification.json).
