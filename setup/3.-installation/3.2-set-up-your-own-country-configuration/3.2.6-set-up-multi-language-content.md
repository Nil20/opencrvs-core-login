# 3.2.7 Set-up language content

It is possible to amend all text copy in OpenCRVS and as as many translations as you like.



**Technical background**

Content management approach is developed in OpenCRVS using [FormatJS](https://formatjs.io/) .  It is worthwhile reading their documentation to understand how this technically works, particularly this [page](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/basic-internationalization-principles).

FormatJS uses industry-wide i18n standards that allow the JSON created to imported into enterprise level content management systems such as [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) or [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/).  As an example we automatically export files ready for Contentful import if you wish to use it, although it is not necessary and you can customise any content integration you like using code in the Farajaland country configuration repository.



**Editing text content**

If you are not using a content management system, you edit text copy directly in static JSON files that are served to the client. Therefore, you will need a code editor like VSCode, explained in step 3.1.5 Tooling.

You can edit copy at any time, even after OpenCRVS goes live.  The code to serve this JSON is given to you in the country configuration repo. &#x20;

Client Application: Internationalisation and languages can be configured in [client.json](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-blob/master/src/features/languages/generated/client/client.json).  The client JSON looks like this:

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "lang": "en",
      "displayName": "English",
      "messages": {
        "buttons.add": "Add",
        "buttons.apply": "Apply",
        ...
```



SMS Notifications: Internationalisation and languages can be configured in [notification.json](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-blob/master/src/features/languages/generated/notification/notification.json).



**Setting up a content management system**

It requires some expertise in NodeJS if you want to set up a content management system other than Contentful. &#x20;

You can see the functions that decide to serve either the static JSON text files or JSON from Contentful [here](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/21bebbe0e05bc7d926e57c2009f5792618045e8a/src/features/languages/service/service.ts#L80).  If you want to use a different system, you can code whatever integration you like in the **getLanguages** function provided it returns language JSON to the clients in the same format as the static JSON files.

Update this environment [variable](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/21bebbe0e05bc7d926e57c2009f5792618045e8a/src/constants.ts#L81) to enable a content management system appropriately.

If you are using Contentful ...

To perform an initial import to Contentful:

1. First create a space in Contentful and add your locales for your translations. Copy your **space-id** from Contentful settings.
2. Download and install the [Contentful cli](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli)
3. Run the following command to export your space as you will need ids for your locales: `contentful space export --space-id=<your-space-id>`
4. Open the exported file and copy the required ids to this [file](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/master/src/features/languages/scripts/constants.ts)
5. You can run the following command to generate a **contentful-import.json** file: `yarn contentful:prepare:import`
6. Run the Contentful import script: `contentful space import --content-file src/features/languages/generated/contentful-import.json --space-id=<your-space-id>`
7. Get your API key from Contentful settings and add it to an environment variable .env file, or paste [here](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/21bebbe0e05bc7d926e57c2009f5792618045e8a/src/constants.ts#L76) for use in development. DO NOT SUBMIT API KEYS TO A PUBLIC REPO!
