# 3.3.7 Automated backup and restore / Optional external backups

Every day OpenCRVS automatically backs up all databases to the following directories on the manager node. Every 7 days the data is overwritten to save disk space.

Hearth, OpenHIM and the other databases are saved in mongo .gz zip files here:

```
/data/backups/mongo/hearth-dev-<date>.gz
/data/backups/mongo/openhim-dev-<date>.gz
/data/backups/mongo/user-mgnt-<date>.gz
/data/backups/mongo/application-config-<date>.gz
```

Elasticsearch snapshot files and indices are saved here:

```
/data/backups/elasticsearch
```

InfluxDB backup files are saved here:

```
/data/backups/influxdb/<date>
```

To perform a restore, ensure that you have backup files in the day's folders you wish to restore from.

Backup files:

The Hearth, OpenHIM and User db backup zips you would like to restore from:&#x20;

**hearth-dev-{date}.gz**

**openhim-dev-{date}.gz**

**user-mgnt-{date}.gz**&#x20;

**application-config-{date}.gz**&#x20;

must exist in /data/backups/mongo/{date} folder.



The Elasticsearch backup folder **/data/backups/elasticsearch** must exist with all previous snapshots and indices.&#x20;

All files are required The InfluxDB backup files must exist in the /data/backups/influxdb/{date} folder

1. SSH into the manager node
2. Make sure you are a root user
3. cd to the /tmp/compose/infrastructure directory

Run the following script as root but beware that **ALL DATA WILL BE REPLACED BY YOUR BACKUP DATA**

```
./emergency-restore-metadata.sh <day of the week to restore from> <number of server replicas: 1 3 or 5>
```

If you configured a separate backup server and used the external backup optional properties in the Ansible script in step [3.3.2 Install dependencies](3.3.2-install-dependencies.md), these files are automatically backed up to that server in the middle of the night.

We highly recommend that once a week, these files should be saved to a password protected and encrypted external harddrive and stored in a secure and approved location.
