# 7.3 Setting up alerts

All alerts and thresholds can be managed in **Management -> Stack Management -> Alerts and Insights -> Rules and Connectors.** OpenCRVS comes with a set of preconfigured alerts, but these might not be enough for your monitoring needs.&#x20;

When you are setting up new alerts, it is important to select "Index" as the connection type. This means that Kibana writes the alerts to an index from where our alerting tool [Elastalert2](https://github.com/jertel/elastalert2) reads alerts before sending an email to `ALERT_EMAIL` email configured as part of the [deployment](../3.-installation/3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment/3.3.6-deploy.md).&#x20;
