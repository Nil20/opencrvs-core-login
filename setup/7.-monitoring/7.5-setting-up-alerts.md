# 7.4 Setting up alerts

All alerts and thresholds can be managed through **Management -> Stack Management -> Alerts and Insights -> Rules and Connectors.** OpenCRVS comes with a set of preconfigured alerts, but we recommended these alerts be customised to your country's needs. Currently, OpenCRVS supports only email alerts out of the box, but other types are available by customising your country config package.

**Preconfigured alerts:**

* CPU load on any node exceeds 70%
* A service throws an exception
* Less than 30% of available disk space on data storage

### Setting up a new alert

When you are setting up new alerts, it is important to select "Index" as the connection type. This means that Kibana writes the alerts to an index from where our alerting tool [Elastalert2](https://github.com/jertel/elastalert2) reads alerts before sending an email to `ALERT_EMAIL` email configured as part of the [deployment](../3.-installation/3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment/3.3.6-deploy.md).&#x20;
