# 7.2 Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

The OpenCRVS monitoring stack comes with a pre-installed Application Performance Monitoring tool (APM). You can find this tool in Kibana by navigating to **Observability -> APM -> Services**. This view gives you a good view of the health of each individual service and helps you discover bottlenecks in the installation.
