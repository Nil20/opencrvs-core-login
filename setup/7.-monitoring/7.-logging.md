# 7.# Logging

All services in the OpenCRVS architecture emit logs that can be observed in real-time. The most common use case for viewing logs is debugging an issue with the installation. These logs of each service are collected automatically by Docker Swarm and sent to Kibana for developers and maintainers to easily access. The items include information about HTTP requests and responses, informational logging (e.g. auth service sending a verification SMS) and errors happening as part of requests.&#x20;
