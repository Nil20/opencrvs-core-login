# 7. Monitoring

OpenCRVS comes with a pre-installed suite of tools for monitoring and debugging a live installation. [The Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack) is used to monitor the infrastructure, applications and dependencies and also for sending alerts on application errors and system health.&#x20;

#### The monitoring setup of OpenCRVS features:

* Reading & searching for application logs
* Measuring infrastructure load to know when to scale up
* Getting analytics & usage statistics of the installation
* Setting up alerts for application errors and infrastructure health issues

Once the environment is installed, the monitoring suite can be accessed using the _kibana.\<your\_domain>_ URL.&#x20;
