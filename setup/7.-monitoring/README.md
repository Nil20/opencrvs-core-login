# 7. Monitoring

OpenCRVS comes with a pre-installed suite of tools for monitoring and debugging a live installation. [The Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack) is used to monitor the infrastructure, applications and dependencies and also for sending alerts on application errors and system health.&#x20;

#### The monitoring setup of OpenCRVS features:

* Reading & searching for application logs
* Insights on infrastructure performance & usage to know when to scale up
* Setting up alerts for application errors and for infrastructure health issues

### Getting started

Once the environment is installed, the monitoring suite can be accessed using the `kibana.<your_domain>` __ URL.&#x20;

The login credentials are the ones you used as `KIBANA_USERNAME`  and `KIBANA_PASSWORD` as part of the [deployment](../3.-installation/3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment/3.3.6-deploy.md). &#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
These tools are only available for server-hosted environments and are not part of the development environment.
{% endhint %}

### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

The OpenCRVS monitoring stack comes with a pre-installed Application Performance Monitoring tool (APM). This tool collects performance metrics, errors and HTTP request information from each of the services in the OpenCRVS stack. You can find this tool in Kibana by navigating to **Observability -> APM -> Services**. This tool can be used to catch anomalies such as errors happening inside the services. It can also be used to detect bottlenecks and to know which services should be scaled up.
