# 7.# Application logs

All services in the OpenCRVS architecture emit logs that can be observed in real-time. The most common use case for viewing logs is debugging an issue with the installation. These logs of each service are collected automatically by Docker Swarm and sent to Kibana for developers and maintainers to easily access. The items include information about HTTP requests and responses, informational logging (e.g. auth service sending a verification SMS) and errors happening as part of requests.&#x20;

#### Application logs

To access logs of a specific service, first, log in to Kibana and navigate to **Observability** -> **APM**, open up the service you want to observe **** and navigate to the **Logs -** tab. In this view, you see the complete standard output of the microservice. You can also search log items by providing a time range.

#### Log stream

By navigating to **Observability** -> **Logs** -> **Stream**, you see all logs of all applications in real time



**Using `x-correlation-id` header to follow a specific request**

Sometimes you want to get all log entries from all the different services a request went through. This can be done by following the `x-correlation-id` found in all requests originating from the OpenCRVS Gateway service.&#x20;
