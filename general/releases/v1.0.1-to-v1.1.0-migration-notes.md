# v1.0.1 to v1.1.0 Migration notes

We have worked hard to ensure that migrating from v1.0 to v1.1 is as easy as possible.



1. Navigate to your opencrvs-core directory, checkout the **release-v1.1.0** or **master** branch and pull latest changes.  Yarn install dependency upgrades:

`cd <path on your environment>/opencrvs-core`

`git fetch`

`git checkout release-v1.1.0`&#x20;

_or (until January 2023 when master will evolve again):_ `git checkout master`

`git pull`

`yarn --force`



2\. You will now have the release code.  Your next step is to rebase any changes you need from the country configuration repository fork.

3\. Navigate to your forked country configuration repo
